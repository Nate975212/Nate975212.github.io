# About Me

## Interests

* Writing - As an aspiring novelist, I spend a large amount of my free time editing my most-recently finished novel and writing short stories for upcoming competitions.

* Lifting - Unlike my writing, I do not plan to enter any lifting competitions anytime soon, but I think excercise is important and I keep up with my lifts throughout the week. Just don't ask about my Bench Max; the less said about that, the better!

* Academics - Entering Wake Tech last semester as a Data Science major without any non-military schooling in the past eight years, I am excited to be here and am looking forward to the challenge!

* Gaming - I put this last on the list to deflect the eyerolls that might result from putting it first. While not an especially original hobby, I believe I play frequently enough to call it one.

## Websites I Recommend 

1. https://open.spotify.com/ - Spotify is a music streaming website that allows users to search, stream, and even download music, podcasts, and more recently audiobooks. Spotify is easy to navigate and is my personal music-steaming site.

2. https://www.campfirewriting.com/ - Campfire is a website designed to assist writers with planning, structuring, and ultimatey writing their manuscript. Campfire is a tool I use for fictional world design as well as character arcs, and is an excellent organization tool.

3. https://www.youtube.com/ - While it is an obvious choice, it is fair to say that I use Youtube for just about anything I need in terms of obscure information. From informative videos to niche news not covered by large media outlets, if one needs to know it, it probably exists as a youtube video.
